<!-- 
Implement and test a program which will allow users to complete a survey about local facilities. 
The survey has 15 questions with different possible responses — 
some numerical answers and some text answers. 
Only one response is possible for each question. 
Every question has an option of ‘Do not know’. 
You should use a record structure to store details of the survey questions. 
There should also be an option 
in the program to calculate the total number of ‘Do not know’ responses.
You should test the program with five users. -->


<!-- QUESTIONS -->
<!-- How could I create a survey for 5 users? -->
<!-- How can I add an alert saying ("Please choose an answer") if answer is left blank -->
